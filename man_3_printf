.SH NAME
.SH ""

.B _printf
- version for printf function information sharing.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH ""

#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *[FORMAT], ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH ""


The printf function sends formatted output to stdout. printf processes its arguments firstly by
printing the characters it finds in the first argument,
one by one.

Conversion Specifiers

d, i	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

o, u, x, X, b
	The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), unsigned binary (b), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x conversions, and ABCDEF for X conversions.

c	The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.

s	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').

r	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written in reverse order.

R	The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are encrypted using rot13 and then printed

.SH RETURN VALUE
A custom _printf() for learning purposes was developed by cohort  #6 students Kayode Adeniji and Gerald Ugwuanyi as a first group project.
_printf() function format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state should any arise. 
These arguments are placed using the percentage '%' operator
